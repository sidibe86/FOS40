            For some, it’s about belonging to one of the world’s historically oldest and largest non-religious, non-political, fraternal and charitable organization for all parts of society. For others it's about camaraderie, making new friends and a
            brotherhood that stands the test of time. But for most, Freemasonry is a way of life.</p>

              <p>If you see a man who quietly and modestly moves in the sphere of his life; who, without blemish, fulfils his duty as a man, a subject, a husband and a father; who is pious without hypocrisy, benevolent without ostentation, and aids
                his fellow man without self-interest; whose heart beats warm for friendship, whose serene mind is open for licensed pleasures, who in vicissitudes does not despair, nor in fortune will be presumptuous, and who will be resolute in the
                hour of danger; the man who is free from superstition and free from infidelity; who in nature sees the finger of the Eternal Master; who feels and adores the higher destination of man; to whom faith, hope and charity are not mere
                words without any meaning; to whom property, nay even life, is not too dear for the protection of innocence and virtue, and for the defense of truth; the man who towards himself is a severe judge, but who is tolerant with the
                debilities of his neighbour; who endeavors to oppose errors without arrogance, and to promote intelligence without impatience; who properly understands how to estimate and employ his means; who honours virtue though it may be in the
                most humble garment, and who does not favor vice though it be clad in purple; and who administers justice to merit whether dwelling in palaces or cottages; the man who, without courting applause, is loved by all noble-minded men,
                respected by his superiors and revered by his subordinates; the man who never proclaims what he has done, can do, or will do, but where need is will lay hold with dispassionate courage, circumspect resolution, indefatigable exertion
                and a rare power of mind, and who will not cease until he has accomplished his work, and then, without pretension, will retire into the multitude because he did the good act, not for himself, but for the cause of good! If you, my
                friend meet such a man, you will see the personification of brotherly love, relief and truth; and you will have found the ideal of a Freemason.

              <p>Freemasonry instills in its members a moral and ethical approach to life:
                it seeks to reinforce thoughtfulness for others, kindness in the community,
                honesty in business, courtesy in society and fairness in all things.
                Members are urged to regard the interests of the family as paramount but, more importantly, Freemasonry also teaches and practices concern for people, care for the less fortunate and help for those in need. In essence it is a
                beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.</p>

              <p>Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. It has no theology and does not teach any route to salvation. It deals in a man’s relationship with his fellow man not in a man’s relationship with his God. Although
                every lodge meeting is opened and closed with a prayer and its ceremonies reflect the essential truths and moral teachings common to many of the world's great religions, no discussion of religion is permitted in Freemasonry's
                meetings. The one essential qualification means that Freemasonry is open to men of all religions or beliefs and it expects and encourages them to continue to practice his religion or beliefs and to regard its holy book or teachings as
                the unerring standard of truth. The Bible will always be present in a lodge but as the organization welcomes men of all faiths, it is called the Volume of the Sacred Law. Thus, when the Volume of the Sacred Law is referred to in
                ceremonies, to a non-Christian it will be the holy book of his religion or belief and to a Christian it will be the Bible.

                by taking too much of his time or his money, or causing him to act in any way against their interests. Members are invited to give to charity but this should always be within their means and it is entirely up to the individual how
                much they wish to contribute. From its earliest days, Freemasonry has been concerned with the care of orphans, the sick and the aged and with educating the masses. This work continues today. In addition, large sums are given to
                national and local charities.</p>

                members. However, anyone should feel free to approach any Freemason to seek further information. Membership is open to men of all faiths, 21 years of age or older.

                Freemasonry consists of Three Degrees - Entered Apprectice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. However, there are many other Degrees and Orders which are called 'additional' or 'appendant'
                because they add to the foundations established in the first Three Degrees.
                These other Degrees and Orders add to Freemasonry by further expounding upon and illustrating the moral lessons taught within the first Three Degrees. Some of these additional Degrees are numerically superior to the Third Degree but
                this does not affect the fact that they are additional to and not in anyway superior to or higher than the Master Mason Degree. The ranks that these additional Degrees carry have no standing with Freemasonry.

          <H2>Flower of Scotland #40</h2>
          <p>Flower of Scotland Lodge No. was granted a warrant for formation by the Grand Lodge of Côte d’Ivoire (GLCI) and a full charter was issued on the 27th of April 6018. Flower of Scotland Lodge’s motto is “In Deo Fiducia Vinces” to
            paraphrase from the Latin, meaning: "In god is all our trust"
            is instilled in its membership of brotherhood.</p>
          <p>The Flower of Scotland uses Scottish Standard Rite which is an Anglo-Saxon Masonic rite practiced since the beginning of the 17th century in early Scottish lodges, such as Mary's Chapel and Kilwinning No. 0, founded before 1598. Although
            the first fruits of Freemasonry, the ritual will only be codified in the 19th century. The Scottish Standard Rite is distinguished from other English masonry by its particularity to be worked by heart by all members of a lodge, just as
            stonecutters of cathedrals were able to use oral transmission to protect their secret business. The Scottish Rite is also distinguished by its essential relationship with the complementary rank of the "mark degree". The Scottish Standard
            Rite is currently practiced exclusively in Scotland by the Grand Lodge of Scotland and for some time around the world.</p>
